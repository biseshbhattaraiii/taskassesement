Ans : Since I learned coding , I asked myself the same question what is it that excites me about coding . I feel the ability to solve problems in large scale and continously landing on the brain cycle to think of a solution that when gets done come up with a cool output(product) excites me . Coding or in general coding softwares can generally be very rewarding as we can measure the impact our product created to the external world or other users pretty soon . I love learning new stuffs and ability to play and tkinter with the code is kinda my hobby . As my interests roams around building and breaking stuffs , lately i have been learning about issues or vulnerability that may arise due to third party javascript library , dependency confusion which is quite on trend on security nowadays as it mostly leads directly to RCE . I have also been working on my own personal projects developed in vue.js and learning more about nuxt.js

Be able to write code that largely impact various people using the product . Learn various approach about solving a problem and how a problem is treated when arises and correct way of dealing with it .


#### 5) What mediums do you prefer to learn programming?
Ans: I prefer projects based learning from the beginning . Previously when I was starting out , I used to watch a lot of videos and try to copy the same action . Even though it used to work out , I figured it is not as effective and worth it . So reading documentation and figuring out basics and directly jumping in the project is my approach . Although sometimes some complicated matters requires me to watch videos and learn it in the actual correct way before jumping in the project . I prefer learning through documentation , writeups , articles , github , youtube , sometime even course .
