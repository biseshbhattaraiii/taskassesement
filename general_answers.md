# General Questions 

#### 1) What excites or interests you about coding ? What did you learn this week ? 
Ans : Since I learned coding , I asked myself the same question what is it that excites me about coding . I feel the ability to solve problems in large scale and continously landing on the brain cycle to think of a solution that when gets done come up with a cool output(product) excites me . Coding or in general coding softwares can generally be very rewarding as we can measure the impact our product created to the external world or other users pretty soon . I love learning new stuffs and ability to play and tinker with the code is kinda my hobby . As my interests roams around building and breaking stuffs , lately i have been learning about issues or vulnerability that may arise due to third party javascript library , dependency confusion which is quite on trend on security nowadays as it mostly leads directly to RCE . I have also been working on my own personal projects developed in vue.js and learning more about nuxt.js  


#### 2) What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it? 
Ans : While working on a most recent project which is web chrome extension that fetches news from facebook and then show the classified news fake or real in the extension dashboard . Initially the aim was to fetch without the extension but there was no clear API , that could fetch the news that are present in the current user newsfeed and doing in the API way would not be that user friendly . So the challenge here was how to fetch the real time news and on what basis should I classify as there are no proper fake news dataset . So , initially I made a basic extension with authentication and all . The news fetching was done as the classname was same for all the news div . Once the news where fetched it was stored in MongoDB by passing the data to the backend . Because we dont want to see the news in the dashboard again and again flags like seen boolean were set . But the challenge here was the process of classifying and refetching was only being done after the fetch button was clicked . Running the code in certain interval was needed as we want it to be realtime and keep on fetching which would again increase the load my local server . This was solved temporarily by making the frontend fetch news only after a chunk of news is processed . Regarding the classifing part news from many valid sources were scraped and Natural language process was used to classify the difference between the facebook fetched news . 

#### 3) Talk about your preferred development environment (tools and technologies you prefer using) or a cool project that you've recently worked on (if any)
Ans: I am a huge linux(arch) fan boy . I have been using linux since around 4 years now . So the distro i prefer using most often is arch linux as I have been using it since quite sometime and I know about it . I also prefer fedora , debian.
The tools I used mostly everyday are VSCode for coding to note keeping , git , BurpSuite for hacking(ethical) . In terms of other technologies , I prefer because I know them are  Python , Javascript , bash scripting , azure for hosting , BurpSuite for API testing , docker etc . Recently I worked on a oracle project which was pretty fun , as it was completely new to me . Mostly I work in PL/SQL and write various business login and backend in PL/SQL while the frontend was in HTML/CSS 
 
#### 4) What is your general expectation from this internship program? 
Ans: I belive being a intern in introcept , my strong exceptation is to learn from other amazing peers and tutors . Be able to watch closely from development of the product to its production . Be able to write code that largely impact various people using the product . Learn various approach about solving a problem and how a problem is treated when arises and correct way of dealing with it .


#### 5) What mediums do you prefer to learn programming?
Ans: I prefer projects based learning from the beginning . Previously when I was starting out , I used to watch a lot of videos and try to copy the same action . Even though it used to work out , I figured it is not as effective and worth it . So reading documentation and figuring out basics and directly jumping in the project is my approach . Although sometimes some complicated matters requires me to watch videos and learn it in the actual correct way before jumping in the project . I prefer learning through documentation , writeups , articles , github , youtube , sometime even course .
